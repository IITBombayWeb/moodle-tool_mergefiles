# Merge PDF Files

#### Moodle Plugin for merging pdf files in a course.

The ‘Merge PDF Files’ plugin offers the user a convenient way by which they can merge the files (only PDF documents) in a Moodle course.

**This plugin requires two external tools:**

 * [PDFtk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) (short for PDF Toolkit) is a cross-platform tool for manipulating Portable Document Format (PDF) documents.
 * [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) – A document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

The module is created and is currently being developed at IIT Bombay (India). <br>
